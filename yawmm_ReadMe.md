## ;[CONFIG FILE USAGE ](.md): ##

; wm\_config.txt resides in sd:/wad, and it is optional. You will get all the prompts if you don't have this file. If you are missing this file, copy and paste the entire [CONFIG FILE USAGE ](.md) Section to a new text file, rename it wm\_config.txt, and Save it to sd:/wad.

**; To bypass any of the params, just comment out the line using a ";" at the beginning of the line**

; If you don't have any of the other parameters, it will prompt you for it

; The param keywords are case-sensitive at this point.

; No spaces precede the keyword on a line

; If you don't have a password in the config file, the default is no password

; If you don't have a startupPath, the default is /wad

; Blank lines are ignored.

; Password=your\_password ("LRUD" only, where L=left, R=right, U=up, D=down on the WiiMote or GC Controller, max 10 characters)

; StartupPath=startupPath (starting at the root dir "/"). Be sure that the path exists, else you will get an error.



**;Password=UDLR**

**;StartupPath=/myWAD**

; Example of StartupPath at the root of the SD card

;StartupPath=/

; cIOS: 249, 222, whatever

**;cIOSVersion=249**

; FatDevice: sd usb usb2 gcsda gcsdb
